   - The submitted documents are collected and verified by the claims processing department.
   - Physical copies may need to be verified for authenticity and completeness.

3. **Data Entry:**
   - Information from the physical forms is manually entered into a database or system by data entry staff.

4. **Review and Assessment:**
   - Claims are reviewed by a claims adjuster or examiner, who assesses the validity and eligibility of the claim.
   - This may involve cross-referencing with other physical documents or records.

5. **Decision and Communication:**
   - A decision is made regarding the claim, which may involve approval, rejection, or request for additional information.
